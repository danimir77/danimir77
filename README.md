<h1> What about me?</h1>
<h3>Hello! I am a computer technician and an Economist. Throughout my career I have worked integrating process consulting, statistics and software development.
I have also graduated as a Fullstack developer at SoyHenry.com with the purpose of using all my knowledge developing software.
I started in 2007 in an international business consultancy. I was a analyst leader. I had the opportunity to manage teams in transformation projects but mainly doing process analysis.
Since 2015 I founded Factum Consultancy. As a consultant I have developed desktop solutions in VB.Net+ Mysql and then Web apps in JavaScript+PHP in order to improve industrial processes, productivity and quality.
I have gained experience in more than 50 companies in many countries in America, and in many diverse areas. I believe that this experience has allowed me to understand clients and customers' needs very well.

I enjoy developing applications that make people's work easier and allow them to add more value to their businesses.</h3>
